# Analysis of Handwritten digits in R

This repo is the work for a year 2 module "Programming for Data Analysis". Each directory has a pdf summarising the results of the assignments.

For Assignment 1, I used KNN to classify the digits initially considering every pixel. I then looked at how eigenvectors, box selection and blurring could be used to get the optimum balance of speed and accuracy in classification.

For Assignment 2, I created models for generating "fake" handwritten digits for the numbers 2 and 4, and assessed their accuracy against the real handwritten digit dataset. I also used principle component analysis for generating new digits.
